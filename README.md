# RaspberryPi-Garage-System
This is a project to demonstrate the use of OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to identify number plates using image processing. 

## Welcome to the RaspberryPi Garage System. In this program we will build a garage system using a RaspberryPi and an image processing library known as OpenALPR (Automatic License Plate Recognition) to detect the number plate using image processing. 

### Things you will need: 
* RaspberryPi (This demonstration uses a RaspberryPi 3 Model B+)
* Resistors
* Jumper Cables
* Servo Motor
* Ultrasonic Sensor
* Raspberry Pi Camera or Web Cam
* A garage model (Which you can make out of a shoe box or something...)

### Programming Language : Python

## Let's Began!
Make the connections to the RaspberryPi as shown in the following schematic diagram (or make your own connection and modify in the program as you please).
